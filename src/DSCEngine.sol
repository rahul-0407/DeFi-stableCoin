 * This system is designed to be as minimal as possible, and have the tokens maintain a 1 token == $1 peg.
 * This stabelCoin has the properties:
 * - Exogenous Collateral
 * - Dollar Pegged
 * - Algorithmatically Stable
 *
 * It is similar to DAI id DAI had no governance, no fees, and was only backed by WETH and WBTC.
 *
 * @notice This contract is the core of the DSC System. It handles all the logic for mining and redeeming DSC, as well as depositing & withdrawing collateral.
 * @notice This contract is very loosely based on the MakerDAO DSS (DAI) system.
